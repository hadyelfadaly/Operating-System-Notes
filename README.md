# Operating System Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes created while studying from the Operating System Concepts textbook and its PDF version.
All notes are written in Markdown and organized by chapters for clarity, revision, and long-term reference.

The goal of this repo is to maintain a clean, structured, and easy-to-navigate set of notes that can be reviewed anytime throughout the course or later as a reference.

 ## Structure

- Notes are organized by chapter
- Images and diagrams are stored in dedicated folders
- Each chapter has its own Markdown file for clean navigation

## Purpose

These notes are meant to help with:

- Understanding the material in a simple, concise format
- Revising before exams
- Keeping a permanent reference for core OS concepts
